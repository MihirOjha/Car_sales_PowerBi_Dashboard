This is a PowerBi report that analyses Car sales for a car dealership. This dashboard integrates key metrics such as monthly sales trends, revenue, and profit margins, all visualized through interactive charts and graphs. For instance, line charts can highlight sales trends over time, while bar and pie charts can illustrate sales distribution by car model and region. The dashboard also features dynamic slicers, enabling users to filter data by various dimensions such as time period, model, and region, providing a customized and detailed analysis.
